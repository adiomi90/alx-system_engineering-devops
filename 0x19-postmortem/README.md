# 🚨 Post-Mortem: The Great Web Application Outage of 2024 🚨

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** 
  The outage was like a surprise guest at a party, arriving unannounced at 10:00 PM (UTC) on April 15, 2024, and refusing to leave until 2:00 AM on April 16, 2024.
- **Impact:** 
  Our primary web application decided to take an unscheduled nap, leaving approximately 30% of our users locked out and the remaining 70% feeling like they were stuck in a slow-motion video.
- **Root Cause:** 
  The culprit behind the chaos turned out to be a sneaky database deadlock lurking in the shadows, triggered by the sheer enthusiasm of our users.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Timeline:
- **April 15, 2024, 10:00 PM (UTC):** 
  Like a well-timed plot twist in a thriller movie, monitoring alerts screamed for attention, signaling trouble ahead.
- **April 15, 2024, 10:05 PM:** 
  Engineers donned their detective hats and embarked on a mission to uncover the mystery behind the performance degradation.

## 🔍 Actions Taken:
- Delved into application logs, suspecting foul play in the code that could be causing database queries to lock horns.
- Scrutinized server metrics, hoping to catch the culprit red-handed, but alas, no luck.
- Initially pointed fingers at the database, thinking it might be sulking due to a misconfiguration or bottleneck.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
- Chased ghosts in the codebase, overlooking the real culprit lurking in the shadows of the database.
- Went on a wild goose chase through the network infrastructure, suspecting a conspiracy of connectivity issues.

## ⚠️ Escalation:
- With no luck cracking the case, the incident was escalated to the database administration team and senior software sleuths.

## 🔧 Incident Resolution:
- After much head-scratching and a deep dive into database logs, the culprit was finally unmasked—frequent deadlocks under peak load conditions.
- Implemented database schema modifications to teach the database some conflict resolution skills.
- Rolled out code changes to handle deadlock scenarios like a seasoned negotiator, introducing retries for affected operations.
- Monitored the system post-resolution to ensure it was no longer playing hide and seek.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause Explanation:** 
  The villain behind the outage was none other than a database deadlock, causing transactions to lock horns like stubborn rams.
- **Resolution Details:** 
  By tweaking the database schema and coaching the code to handle deadlock scenarios more gracefully, peace was restored in our digital realm.

## 🛠️ Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Beef up monitoring to catch mischievous deadlocks before they wreak havoc.
  - Put the system through its paces with regular load testing to uncover any lurking performance gremlins.
  - Give the database a makeover with optimized query patterns to minimize contention and keep the peace.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Implement automated deadlock detection and resolution mechanisms, turning our system into a conflict resolution guru.
  - Conduct a thorough review of database schema and transaction management to identify further optimization opportunities.
  - Fine-tune incident response procedures to ensure smoother escalations and quicker resolutions, just like a well-oiled detective agency.

With the mystery solved and preventative measures in place, our web application is ready to face the digital jungle with confidence, armed with the knowledge gained from this rollercoaster ride of an outage.
